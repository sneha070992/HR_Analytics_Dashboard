## Topics Covered:
- **Data Cleaning & Processing:** Cleaned raw HR data using Power Query to ensure accurate insights.
- **Power BI Dashboard Setup:** Built a cohesive and interactive dashboard layout.
- **Data Import:** Imported CSV data with columns like EmpID, Age, Attrition, Job Role, Salary, etc.
- **Power Query:** Applied transformations for data cleansing and processing in Power BI.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Used DAX formulas for calculated fields, measures, and dynamic analysis.
- **Charts & Visuals:** Created various types of charts (bar, pie, and line charts) for clear data representation.
- **Filters & Slicers:** Added interactive filters and slicers for dynamic data analysis.
- **Exporting Dashboard:** Provided options to export reports and visuals from Power BI.
